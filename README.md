# Pub!

**Pub** is a Laravel project to run a pub's online ordering. It uses:

- [Laravel 5](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) with Eloquent
- [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) styled [Boostrap 4](https://getboostrap.com)
- Raw [ECMAScript 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) (whilst Bootstrap requires jQuery and Popper, I didn't use either of them)
- [Notyf](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf) for lovely notifications.

# Media

I created the category images using images from Google Search. Additionally, this project uses random images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), using the category name to get a *slightly* related image instead of a boring placeholder.

# Tech

- Runs with PHP v7.4 (^7.2.5)
- Connects to a MySQL database with InnoDB engines (Laravel likes InnoDB more)
- Whilst the submission is on a SOCEM server, it's been run on WAMP & LAMP servers perfectly fine.
